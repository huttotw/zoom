# zoom

Zoom is a load testing utility capable of generating different requests according to some template. This should be used to simulate lots of users on a system, or a bunch of random requests at some endpoint.

## Running
To run a load test and send a new KSUID and random number each time:
```
docker run huttotw/zoom:latest zoom -n 10000 -concurrency 10 -url http://localhost:8080 -template '{"id":"{{ ksuid }}","num":{{ intn 100 }}}' -method POST
```

This will send 10,000 `POST` requests, 10 at a time, to `http://localhost:8080` with a payload formatted like:
```json
{"id":"1FDJSGnlAp4C9XTHZQ2XM0u8vFx","num":15}
```

## Adding new template functions
Since we use `text/template` to form each request, adding new functions to be available at execution time is as simple as adding to the function map in `cmd/zoom/templates.go`. Please see the official documentation for more detail: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#FuncMap.
